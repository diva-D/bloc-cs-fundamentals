#### Exercises

#### Short Answer
> 1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: A teacher searching an unsorted stack of papers for a particular student's assignment.


> 2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Searching a sorted collection of cds/vinals for a particular artist. You can check the mid of the stack to see if the album is above or below and then repeat until you finally find the right one.


> 3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7 iterations.


> 4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3 iterations.


> 5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear. As the collection is unsorted a binary search doesn't help us at all, since it needs the collection to be sorted in order to determine if the value is higher or lower than the current mid point.


> 6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary. Given we are halfing the data each time it can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to locate our value. If we had a collection of a million items and needed to find the last one, it would take 1 million iterations doing it linearly. If we did a binary search it would only take 17 iterations. 


#### Programming Assignment:
> 1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A:

function wordSearch(dictionary, word) {
 
    let low = 0;
    let high = dictionary.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else if (dictionary[mid] < word) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }
	
	return "Not found";
}

>2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A:

function fishFind(allFish, fish) {
    for (let i = 0; i < allFish.length; i++) {
        if (allFish[i] === fish) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}
